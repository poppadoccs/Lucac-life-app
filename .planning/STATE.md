## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Split before upgrade: LucacLegends.jsx must be split (FOUND-01) before ANY game upgrade work — merge conflicts guaranteed otherwise
- FOUND-03 + SEC-02 before DAN-03/DAN-04: createdBy field and event visibility must exist before Danyells' delete/hide permissions can work
- FOUND-05 before GAME-03: Firebase update + runTransaction imports required for board game turn enforcement
- CLEAN-02 + FOUND-06 before GAME-05: TTS overhaul in utils.js must exist before reading game read-aloud can be fixed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Groq model name for story generation (GAME-04): verify llama-3.3-70b-versatile is still on free tier at dev time
- TTS voice chain (FOUND-06/CLEAN-02): actual voice names are OS-dependent — test on Android tablets (kids' devices) before finalizing
- aiAgent.js: parallel research found this file but it is not in CLAUDE.md architecture table — confirm its state before Phase 1 refactoring
